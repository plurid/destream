## About

`destream` provides a browser extension that allows streamers to control webpages of their followers.

The streamer installs the extension and creates an account. The streamer then lists the account as a streamer account.

The followers install the extension and subscribe to the streamer's account.

The streamer activates the extension on a certain webpage and emits events (plays audio/video, likes media, etc.).

The followers receive a notification when the streamer wants to control a webpage. The followers accept the streamer's control providing the adequate control granularity, allowing full or partial control.

The streamer's events (pauses/plays/like etc.) are reproduced in the followers' browsers.

The streamer/followers can deactivate the webpage control at any time. The stream/followers can replay previous sessions. The streamer can delete sessions.
