## About

`destream` is a browser extension that allows streamers to control web pages in their audience's browser.

The streamer installs the extension and creates an account and lists it as a streamer account. The audience installs the extension and subscribe to the streamer's account. The streamer activates the extension on a certain webpage and emits events (plays audio/video, scrolls the page, reacts to media, etc.).

The audience receives a notification when the streamer wants to control a webpage and accepts the streamer's control providing the adequate control granularity, allowing full or partial control.

The streamer's events (pauses/plays/like etc.) are reproduced in the audience's browsers. The streamer/audience can deactivate the web page control at any time and can replay previous sessions. The streamer can edit/delete sessions.
